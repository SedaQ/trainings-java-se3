/**

 * By default, the number of threads available in a parallel stream is related
 * to the number of available CPUs in your environment. In order to increase the
 * thread count, you would need to create your own custom class.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The Stream interface includes a method isParallel() that can be used to test
 * if the instance of a stream supports parallel processing. Some operations on
 * streams preserve the parallel attribute, while others do not. For example,
 * the Stream.concat(Stream s1, Stream s2) is parallel if either s1 or s2 is
 * parallel. On the other hand, flatMap() creates a new stream that is not
 * parallel by default, regardless of whether the underlying elements were
 * parallel.
